# horiseon-refactor

## Description

I needed to know why some websites tend to get overlooked while others appear near the top of any search engine searches, and as it turns out, a lot of it has to do with the website's internal structure through HTML. I built this project to gain experience with investigating another person's code, altering said code in a non-desctructive manner, track my changes throughout the project, and seeing how to make the website more accessible. By utilizing semantic HTML elements, I can improve the likelihood that people can find this website more easily and from a business standpoint turn those people into potential customers or business partners.
